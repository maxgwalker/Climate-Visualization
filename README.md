# Climate-Visualizations

## Visualize how the climate has changed since the 1880s

With temperature readings paired with geographic coordinates, I made visualizations to better understand if and where global temperatures have been changing. The dataset used does not provide specific temperature readings, but rather provides the information relative to the average of that specific location at that specific month from 1971-2000. While this limits the ability to compare temperatures across different locations at a specfic time, it is ideal for comparing data at a given location across time.

"The NOAA Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis Dataset (NOAAGlobalTemp) is a merged land–ocean surface temperature analysis (formerly known as MLOST). It is a spatially gridded (5° × 5°) global surface temperature dataset, with monthly resolution from January 1880 to present. We combine a global sea surface (water) temperature (SST) dataset with a global land surface air temperature dataset into this merged dataset of both the Earth’s land and ocean surface temperatures. The SST dataset is the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) . The land surface air temperature dataset is similar to ERSST but uses data from the Global Historical Climatology Network Monthly (GHCN-Monthly) database. We provide the NOAAGlobalTemp dataset as temperature anomalies, relative to a 1971–2000 monthly climatology, following the World Meteorological rganization convention."
